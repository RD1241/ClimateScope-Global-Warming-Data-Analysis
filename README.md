# 🌍 ClimateScope – Global Warming Data Analysis

## 👋 About the Project
ClimateScope is a data-driven project focused on analyzing global warming and climate change trends using real-world datasets.  
The goal of this project is to apply **data analysis, visualization, and analytical thinking** to understand how Earth's climate indicators have changed over time.

This project is part of my learning journey as a **BCA (AI & ML) student**, building a strong foundation for **AI, Machine Learning, and data-focused software development**.
